# Windows

The official way is to use the Windows service feature in 1.4 which works with Windows Vista/7. This is now the default behavior upon installation. To have Synergy ''not'' start on boot, you need to edit the properties of the service and set it to Manual.

# Mac

These instructions are not recommended for most people; instead, simply add the Synergy app to your startup items and enable auto-start in settings.

## Running Synergy on MacOS via plist

Here we create a shell script and a property list file (plist), and activate the plist using the launchctl command-line tool.

The shell script runs the synergyc Unix executable, telling it to connect to a laboratory workstation.

## Make the shell script

First make a little bash script or whatever to contain your synergy calls..

For example, I put mine in <code>~/.scripts/synergyscript.sh</code>

Here's what my script looks like:
<pre>
#!/bin/bash

## Synergy client, connecting to Lab workstation
/Applications/Synergy.app/Contents/MacOS/synergyc -f -d FATAL -n Intrepid 192.168.1.102
</pre>

Here I'm telling the synergy client I'm running to announce my machine's name is ''Intrepid'' and I'm getting to to connect to the ip ''192.168.1.102''.

I used this format so that I might later add additional separate instances of synergy, as this was on a laptop that moves around.

Then make sure you make your script executable: <pre>chmod +x ~/.scripts/synergyscript.sh</pre>

''does it need to be made executable?  we don't need that to run it manually.  Does launchctl or the plist require it?''

Run the script manually to confirm it works: <pre>~/.scripts/synergyscript.sh</pre>

If it works, you should see '''[please describe that here]'''.  If it doesn't work, you might see '''[please describe]'''.  In that case, try '''[please describe]'''.  

## Create the corresponding plist file
I created my plist file under <tt>~/Library/LaunchAgents/ca.dawning.scripts.osx.synergy.plist</tt>

It contains:
<pre>
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC -//Apple Computer//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd >
<plist version="1.0">
  <dict>
    <key>Label</key>
    <string>ca.dawning.scripts.osx.synergy</string>
    <key>Program</key>
    <string>/Users/j/.scripts/synergyscript.sh</string>
    <key>KeepAlive</key>
    <true/>
  </dict>
</plist>
</pre>

## Activate your plist with launchctl
<pre>
launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/ca.dawning.scripts.osx.synergy.plist
</pre>

To unload it, just swap that ''load'' above with ''unload''.

Using a Mac OS X 10.6.8 server with synergys 1.4.12 and a Windows 7 SP1 client with synergyc.exe 1.4.12

## OS X Server
Create a config file ~/Library/Synergy/synergy.conf (or where ever) with the following contents:
<pre>
section: screens
	win:
		alt = super
		super = alt
		halfDuplexCapsLock = false
		halfDuplexNumLock = false
		halfDuplexScrollLock = false
		xtestIsXineramaUnaware = false
		switchCorners = none +top-right +bottom-right 
		switchCornerSize = 0
	osx:
		halfDuplexCapsLock = false
		halfDuplexNumLock = false
		halfDuplexScrollLock = false
		xtestIsXineramaUnaware = false
		switchCorners = none 
		switchCornerSize = 0
end

section: aliases
end

section: links
	win:
		right = osx
	osx:
		left = win
end

section: options
	relativeMouseMoves = false
	screenSaverSync = true
	win32KeepForeground = false
	switchCorners = none +top-left +bottom-left 
	switchCornerSize = 32
end
</pre>

Create a file ~/bin/initsynergy.command with the following contents:
 #!/bin/bash
 
 # Hides tray icon. set to 0 to have it show again.
 defaults write /Applications/Synergy.app/Contents/Info LSUIElement 1
 
 /Applications/Synergy.app/Contents/MacOS/synergys --enable-crypto --config ~/Library/Synergy/synergy.conf -n osx -l /var/log/synergy.log

Make sure you:
 sudo touch /var/log/synergy.log
 sudo chown YOUROSXUSERNAME /var/log/synergy.log

Add ~/bin/initsynergy.command to your account's Login Items in System Preferences -> Accounts -> Login Items

# Linux

Start synergy client (synergyc) on Fedora 22 using LightDM

Apply all command as root, from a command line TTY (text console or remote SSH)

Install LightDM <pre>
dnf install lightdm
systemctl stop gdm
systemctl disable gdm
killall -u gdm
systemctl enable lightdm
systemctl start lightdm
</pre>

Create a start/stop script
<pre>vi /etc/lightdm/syneryc-start.sh</pre><pre>
#!/bin/sh
# script to start/stop synergyc
killall synergyc
case $0 in *stop*) exit 0 ;; esac  # exit now if called 'stop'
synergyc -n `hostname -s` -d INFO YOUR_SYNERGYS_SERVER_HOSTNAME
exit 0
</pre>
Link as a stop script
<pre>ln -s syneryc-start.sh /etc/lightdm/syneryc-stop.sh</pre>
Tell lightdm to call scripts
<pre>vi /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf.d/synergy.conf</pre><pre>
[SeatDefaults]
greeter-setup-script=/etc/lightdm/syneryc-start.sh
session-setup-script=/etc/lightdm/syneryc-stop.sh</pre>

Remove that last line if the user does not want to start his own synergyc daemon.

Originates from Bug #1755   -- This GDM method no longer works in Fedora 22 :-(

Howto start synergy client (synergyc) at boot on FC11 (Fedora Core 11)

This is not really a bug report - but just some hints how to successfuly install synergyc so that it start at boot in Fedora Core 11. 
Please integrate this in the main help.

<pre>
/etc/gdm/Init/Default:
# This script needs to start synergyc as user root - this synergyc runs on the
# login screen. IMPORTANT: I've found that at boot time NAME LOOKUP does not
# YET work so you MUST use the server's IP ADDRESS otherwise synergyc will
# fail to connect and exit after a few seconds (--reconnect does not work):
# so the BUG REPORT/enhancement request would be to make --reconnect work so
# that it never/ever exits synergyc - even if name lookup does not work, or
# if there is no display, etc.. As a (bad) alternative you can also use: 
# (sleep 10; /usr/bin/synergyc YOUR_SERVER_HOSTNAME) &
# NOTE: I've also found that sometimes you need to kill synergyc with -9
/usr/bin/killall -9 synergyc 
sleep 1 
/usr/bin/synergyc YOUR_SERVER_IP

/etc/gdm/PostLogin/Default:
# this script needs to kill the root synergyc started by Init/Default
/usr/bin/killall synergyc 
sleep 1 

/etc/gdm/Xsession:
# this script will start the user synergyc - the one that runs after you have logged in 
# Note: here you can also use your server's hostname, instead of the IP
/usr/bin/killall synergyc # no need, I guess?
sleep 1 
/usr/bin/synergyc YOUR_SERVER_IP
</pre>

I took a different approach - wrote a script to start/stop synergyc. 

I changed my scripts as follows:

<pre>
# end of file, before exit 0
/etc/gdm/Init/Default:# SYNERGY BEGIN
/etc/gdm/Init/Default:# start synergy as root user (login screen)
/etc/gdm/Init/Default:/usr/local/bin/synergyc-ctl.sh start
/etc/gdm/Init/Default:# SYNERGY END

# top of file, after comments
# For at least CentOS 6.2, this needs to be in /etc/gdm/PreSession/Default
/etc/gdm/PostLogin/Default:# SYNERGY BEGIN
/etc/gdm/PostLogin/Default:# stop root synergy (login screen)
/etc/gdm/PostLogin/Default:/usr/local/bin/synergyc-ctl.sh stop
/etc/gdm/PostLogin/Default:# SYNERGY END

# top of file, after comments
/etc/gdm/Xsession:# SYNERGY BEGIN
/etc/gdm/Xsession:# start synergy as login user
/etc/gdm/Xsession:/usr/local/bin/synergyc-ctl.sh start
/etc/gdm/Xsession:# SYNERGY END
</pre>

Here's also /usr/local/bin/synergyc-ctl.sh:

Here is an [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mark-vdb/scripts/master/synergy/synergy-ctl.sh updated version of this script] which includes support for setting crypto, display, logs, screenname.

<pre>
#!/bin/sh
OP=${1}

# put the synergy server IP here (at boot time name lookup does not work
# and synergyc will fail and exit, using the IP prevents the problem)
SERVER_IP=192.168.1.10

SYNERGYC=/usr/bin/synergyc
PS=/bin/ps
GREP=/bin/grep
WC=/usr/bin/wc
PIDOF=/sbin/pidof
SLEEP=/bin/sleep

# check synergyc is running
function sc_check
{
  N=`${PS} -ef | ${GREP} "${SYNERGYC}"  | ${GREP} -v "${GREP}" | ${WC} -l`
  return $N
}

# kill synergyc if running
function sc_kill
{
  SIG=""
  while true
  do
    sc_check
    if [ $? -eq 1 ]
    then
      PIDS=`${PIDOF} "${SYNERGYC}"`
      if [ ${PIDS} != "" ]
      then
        kill ${SIG} ${PIDS}
      fi
    else
      break
    fi

    ${SLEEP} 1
    SIG="-9"
  done
}

# start synergyc
function sc_start
{
  while true
  do
    ${SYNERGYC} "${SERVER_IP}"

    ${SLEEP} 2

    sc_check
    if [ $? -eq 1 ]
    then
      break
    fi
  done
}

case "${OP}" in
  start)
    sc_kill
    sc_start
  ;;
  stop)
    sc_kill
  ;;
  *)
    echo "usage: synergyc-ctl [start|stop]"
    exit 1
  ;;
esac

exit 0
</pre>

You can also simply put the command to start synergy as a daemon in ~/.xinitrc, though this won't give you the fine-grained control of a startup script.

 synergys --daemon --restart --display :0 --address 10.137.10.163
